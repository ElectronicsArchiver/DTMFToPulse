## What is a state machine?
A state machine is a piece of code which moves between a number of states, a bit like a piece on a Snakes & ladders board. Each state runs a little bit of code, which then can do something and then 'jump' to another state. You often find these used to reliably progress some form of processing, be that for some inputs or to generate some outputs, or do both at the same time (yes you can have multiple pieces/states in play at once, but you really need to know what you are doing). Quite often what was a horrid nest of IF THEN ELSE statements with random timers in it converts into a more readily readable state machine.
