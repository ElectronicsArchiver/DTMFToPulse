The conversion is done using **State Machines** & **Countdown Timers**.

</div>

<br>
<br>

## Limitation

The `delay()` function cannot be used as the <br>
digital **DTMF** input can occur at any time and <br>
it's signal changes are faster than any output. <br>

Thus the delay function cannot even be used <br>
for pulse generation, since this could mean <br>
dropping pulses of the **DTMF** tone.

<br>
<br>

## Configuration

At the start of the source file you can find <br>
preprocessor definitions that allow you to:

- Control the behavior when hangups occur

- Adjust how quickly dials are pulsed

- Set whether to stay LOW / HIGH when idle

<br>

*In the section below the previous you* <br>
*will find the various timing presets.*
